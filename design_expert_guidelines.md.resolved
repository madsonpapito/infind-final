## 2. Visual Design System (The "Spy-Tech" Aesthetic)

### Color Palette
*   **Dominant (Backgrounds):**
    *   `Deep Navy`: `#0A1128` (Trust, Authority, The "Dark Web" feel without being dirty).
    *   `Void Black`: `#050814` (For high contrast sections).
*   **Primary (Action/Solution):**
    *   `Cyber Cyan`: `#00D9FF` (Technology, Scanning, The "System" working).
    *   `Success Green`: `#25D366` (WhatsApp Green - familiar, implies "Found", "Message Received").
*   **Secondary (Alert/Pain):**
    *   `Orange Warning`: `#FF6B35` (Urgency, "Suspicious Activity", Attention).
    *   `Crimson Red`: `#EF4444` (Danger, "Cheating Confirmed", The fear trigger).

### Typography
*   **Headings:** `Inter` or `Montserrat` (Bold, Sturdy, Trustworthy).
*   **Data/Logs:** `JetBrains Mono` or `Fira Code` (Implies raw data, "hacking", uncovering hidden info).
*   **Body:** `Inter` (Clean, readable, objective).

### UI Elements
*   **Glassmorphism:** Dark transparent cards with thin cyan borders (`border-white/10`).
*   **Micro-animations:**
    *   *Pulse:* Showing background activity/scanning.
    *   *Typing effects:* Simulating real-time data interception.
    *   *Blur:* Used to censor "sensitive" results (creates curiosity/desire).
*   **Imagery:**
    *   High-contrast mockups.
    *   "Locked" content overlays.
    *   Radar/Scan line motifs.

## 3. UX Psychology (The "Fear -> Relief" Loop)

The user is entering the funnel in a state of **High Anxiety**. The design must mirror this journey:

1.  **Phase 1: Validation (The Hook)**
    *   *Goal:* "You are not crazy."
    *   *UI:* Darker tones, questions that hit pain points (Gaslighting, Hidden Phone).
    *   *Element:* Lists of "Red Flags".
2.  **Phase 2: Investigation (The Scan)**
    *   *Goal:* "We are checking for you."
    *   *UI:* High activity, progress bars, technical logs, "Connecting..." states.
    *   *Element:* The "System Log" refactor we just did.
3.  **Phase 3: The "Wait..." Moment (The Cliffhanger)**
    *   *Goal:* "We found something suspicious."
    *   *UI:* Red/Orange alerts. Blurred images.
    *   *Element:* The "Intercepted Media" grid.
4.  **Phase 4: Resolution (The Offer)**
    *   *Goal:* "See the truth now."
    *   *UI:* Bright Button (Green), Trust Badges, "Unlock" iconography.
    *   *Element:* The Payment CTA.

## 4. Implementation Rules for the Funnel

### Do's
*   ✅ **Use Data Density:** Show timestamps, IP addresses (fake/masked), file sizes. Details = Truth.
*   ✅ **Use "Badges":** "Verified", "Encrypted", "Anonymous". These quell fear of being caught.
*   ✅ **Mobilize:** 90% of users are on mobile, hiding in the bathroom. UI must be big, touch-friendly, and load fast on 4G.

### Don'ts
*   ❌ **Don't use "Cute" icons:** Use sharp, thin-stroke icons (Lucide/Feather).
*   ❌ **Don't use White Backgrounds for main content:** It feels too "corporate" and less "secret tool".
*   ❌ **Don't clutter the CTA:** The final button must be the only escape door from the anxiety.

## 5. Next Action Plan (Agent Tasks)
1.  **Audit Landing Pages (`step-1`):** ensure they match the Dark Navy aesthetic of Step 2.
2.  **Enhance Animations:** Add `framer-motion` for smooth entry animations (e.g., "Scan Lines").
3.  **Optimize Mobile:** Verify clear readability and thumb-zone placement for buttons.
